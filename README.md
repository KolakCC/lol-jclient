Tested on Windows 7 & 8 and OS X Mountain Lion. Linux is also supported, except for running the game for now.

##Requirements
On Windows you need to install [swftools](http://www.swftools.org/swftools-2013-04-0
9-1007.exe).

On Mac use Homebrew to install it with `brew install swftools`


##Why create an alternative client to the PVP.net client?
I decided to make one because I was fed up by the multitude of bugs in the official client. Hopefully lol-jclient will provide a bug-free version with more frequent updates.
